# YouTube Assistant

The YouTube Assistant app leverages LLM techniques and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to deliver insightful user interactions. Built using LangChain and Streamlit, the app processes YouTube links by extracting video transcripts and utilising them as context to answer user questions. This design ensures that responses are highly relevant and grounded in the video's content, offering an intuitive and efficient way for users to engage with video material and extract meaningful insights.
